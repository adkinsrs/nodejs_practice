This repository is for me to practice writing code from the book Web Development with Node & Express from Ethan Brown (O'Reilly)

Personal notes:
* I installed a more recent version of Node on my machine.  This version calls the executable 'nodejs' instead of 'node' (which would have been installed via nodejs-legacy).  The book uses the 'node' executable.
* For the meadowlark.js app, I will cp off the code from each iterative step, so that I can see the progression.  However I will not copy off each iteration of the other code (like Handlebars, or CSS)
* It may seem silly to type these code examples in, when I could just copy the files from the O'Reilly site, but I find it helps me understand it better when I type in each line at a time.

Lessons I skipped writing code for:
* Ch 2 - Serving Static Resources
* Ch 3 - Dynamic Content in Views
