This repository is for me to practice writing code from the book Web Development with Node & Express from Ethan Brown (O'Reilly)

Personal notes:
* I installed a more recent version of Node on my machine.  This version calls the executable 'nodejs' instead of 'node' (which would have been installed via nodejs-legacy).  The book uses the 'node' executable.
